# Real-Time Face Detection using Python

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a real-time face detection system using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
It detects human faces from a live webcam feed and highlights them using bounding boxes.

This project was developed as an **academic / learning project** to understand the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Captures live video stream from the webcam.
2. Converts each frame to grayscale for efficient processing.
3. Applies a Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces.
4. Draws bounding boxes around detected faces in real time.
5. Displays the processed video output on screen.
